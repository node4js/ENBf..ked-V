# Introduction..
### I decided this because ReShade and ENBseries keep fighting.. So why not try to revive Boris Vorontsov's legacy through an open-source utility? *cough cough* NVE, QuantV *cough CHOKE*
---
No bs? This is a Post-Processing tool, with depth access and CamPos access.
# Why?
> Because CamPos allows for reliable placement of volumetric effects (*fog, cloud, mist, dust,* ***you get it***)
- So better quality?
# But why??
> Because whiny kids like to rant about why volumetric effects and *"high-quality puddle reflections"* are better. **/s**
- Oh.. Yeah.
# Features? What do we get?
> Find it out yourself.. cornball.

Really though? ImGui support, SSGI, etc. You get it. Whatever was in ENB will be here. Have fun, breadstick. Don't play in *1366x768*.
